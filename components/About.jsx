          Iâ€™ve been around the software block for a while, dabbling in front-end wizardry. But you know what? Back-end tech has always whispered sweet nothings to me. So, Iâ€™m ready to wade into those server-side waters and broaden my horizons. Letâ€™s build some magic that inspires! ðŸš€

          <h3>MERN Stack Foundation: </h3>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
          Iâ€™ve crafted interactive websites that seamlessly function across all devices and platforms using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.
          Front-end development was my starting point, but I soon realized that my true passion lies in the intricate world of back-end logic.

          <h3>SharePoint Backends: </h3>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
          Professionally, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of designing backends that are structured within SharePoint. Collaborating with teams, Iâ€™ve built efficient workflows and integrated custom solutions.
          SharePointâ€™s complexity has challenged me, but itâ€™s also been immensely rewarding.

          <h3>Current Endeavors: </h3>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
          My learning journey continues! Iâ€™m currently diving into C# and exploring the vast .NET Framework.
          AWS and Docker are next on my listâ€”Iâ€™m eager to master cloud services and containerization.
          </p>
          <h3> A Never-Ending Quest: </h3>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
          I firmly believe that learning is a lifelong pursuit. Our time may be finite, but knowledge is infinite. So, I remain curious, humble, and committed to evolving alongside the ever-changing tech landscape.
