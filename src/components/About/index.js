        Hello! My name is Faissal Shabani and welcome to my portfolio. I'll assume that my name has
        you wondering where I come from, so I'll assist you with that. I was born in the Democratic
        Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire, and came to the states as a refugee due to the Rwandan
        Genocide of '94 and the First and Second Congo Wars. Now, my love for technology mixed with
        a ferocious sense of stubbornness has led me to fall in love with Web Dev. I've found that
        Web Dev allows me to create and use my pursuit of perfection for a meaningful cause. Please
        allow this portfolio to illustrate some of my work and the passion that I have for
        development. Cheers!
