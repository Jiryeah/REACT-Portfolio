### Summary

I have created this application to not only challenge myself, but to also showcase the work that I have accomplished and the skills that I have learned along the way. This portfolio will continue to evolve and grow as I learn new libraries, frameworks, and new performant methods that allow me to properly convey to the world my contribution to this beautiful industry we call Web Development.
